# skip-read-more-button

Some websites use a script to add a "Read More" button that acts as a paywall -- you have to enter a password to read the full content, which is really annoying!

One can try to bypass or skip this step, if that script is merely hiding the content using CSS.

This repo is an example.

## usage

Use a user script manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) to load this script.

If you have Tampermonkey installed, clicking [this link](https://github.com/cksteven/skip-read-more-button/raw/master/skip-read-more-button.user.js) will automatically trigger it to load it to your browser.
